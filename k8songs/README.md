# k8songs: Story-to-Song Generator

k8songs is a web application that transforms user-provided stories into
kid-friendly songs. It leverages the Claude AI API to generate age-appropriate
lyrics based on input narratives. The interface features two main text areas:
one for story input and another for displaying the generated song lyrics.
Users simply paste their story and click the "Make Song" button to initiate
the AI-powered song creation process.

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using jQuery for
DOM manipulation and AJAX requests. It interfaces with the Claude API to
process the story and generate song lyrics suitable for a elementary school
reading level. The simple, intuitive design makes it easy for users to quickly
transform their stories into musical content, potentially serving as an
educational tool or creative writing aid for children and educators.
